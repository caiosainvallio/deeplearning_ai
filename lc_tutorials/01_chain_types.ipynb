      "The narrator was perplexed by the 1401, a machine of which they had no understanding. It could only accept input in the form of data stored on punched cards, which the narrator did not have. Therefore, they were unable to make use of the machine.\n",

      "Before the era of microcomputers, it was both socially and technically wrong to terminate a machine without time-sharing.

      " In around 1980, the narrator managed to convince their father to buy them a TRS-80 computer, which was a viable alternative to the Apple II at the time.

Winograd's SHRDLU program was seen as the potential for the next step in AI.\n",
      "\n",
      " In the past, the commonly used programming languages were limited and the ideas of programmers were similarly limited. At Cornell, the default language was PL/I, similar to Pascal. However, learning Lisp expanded the programmer's concept of a program so quickly that it took years to fully understand it.\n",

      " In 1985, the author enrolled in a program at Cornell University that allowed them to pursue any courses and put any degree on their transcript, which they chose to be \"Artificial\".

      " A student at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) found that they were often confused and demoralized, but kept going with painting as their passion.

      "\n",
      " In the summer of 1995, the author and his team began working on software to create online stores, initially targeting Windows systems. This was based on existing knowledge of how to build an internet storefront.\n",
      "\n",
      " Two people, living in the Unix world, decided to try and write a prototype store builder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart and the other wrote a site generator for stores in Lisp. They worked out of Robert's apartment in Cambridge which was shared with his roommate.\n",

      "A team of developers built a WYSIWYG site builder where the pages looked the same as the static ones that were generated but the links instead referred to closures stored in a hash table.\n",

      " Having a background in art is beneficial for building online stores, as the key to looking professional is having high production values. With the right page layouts, fonts, and colors, even a small business can appear more legitimate than a larger company.\n",

      " Robert recommended Trevor Blackwell to the speaker, which surprised the speaker due to Trevor's plan to reduce his life to a stack of notecards. However, Robert was right, and Trevor ended up being a great person to know.\n",
      "\n",
      " Working with Robert and Trevor was an enjoyable experience. Robert is a highly skilled hacker and Trevor is an independent-minded person. If their brains were visualized, Robert's would look like a colonial New England church and Trevor's would be a mystery.\n",
      "\n",
      " In January 1996, 6 stores opened for business, but the timing was almost too early as ecommerce was still in its early stages and not many people were interested yet.\n",
      "\n",
      " This software was comprised of three components: an editor written by the speaker, a shopping cart written by Robert, and a manager written by Trevor. The editor was known to be one of the best general-purpose site builders at the time, and the speaker ensured that the code was well maintained.\n",
      "\n",
      " The speaker enjoyed working on Robert and Trevor's software and wished that they could have worked on it exclusively for the next 3 years. Unfortunately, they had to do other tasks which they were less skilled with, making the next 3 years more challenging.\n",
      "\n",
      " In the late 90s, a startup created Viaweb, an ecommerce software, with the goal of being as easy to use and inexpensive as Microsoft Word. Being poor helped the startup make Viaweb more affordable than anticipated, with a price of $100 per month.\n",
      "\n",
      " The low price of $300 a month for big stores and a smaller amount for smaller stores was a big attraction for the company, but it wasn't due to any clever insight, as the company had no idea what businesses typically paid for services. Many of the company's successes were due to luck and not deliberate decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      " In order to attract users, the company resorted to desperate measures such as building stores for them, despite the fact that their software was designed to make that sort of action unnecessary.\n",

      " This article discusses how people could use technology to create stores, and how the best images for small items such as shirts was to use a closeup of the collar rather than the whole shirt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This experience taught the author about retail, as they had to rescan 30 images of men's shirts. Even though it felt wrong, the author learned the importance of using their software in order to build stores for users. Initially, the author felt both mystified and repelled.\n",
      "\n",
      " The speaker initially believed that they needed a business person to manage their business, however they changed their mind once they started to get users. From then on, the speaker dedicated themselves to giving their users whatever they wanted. They hoped to have a large number of users one day, but still wanted to give them personal attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of 1996, the startup had about 70 stores, and by the end of 1997, it had grown to 500 stores. The author initially thought that the absolute number of users was the most important factor, but later realized that the growth rate was the ultimate test of a startup.\n",
      "\n",
      " This statement is encouraging a business to not be so stressed out about their current monetary gain and instead focus on their growth rate, which is 7x a year. This message is especially encouraging for startups and is a reminder that a high growth rate will eventually lead to bigger monetary gains.\n",
      "\n",
      " The speaker hired more people than necessary in order to appear professional to investors and because that was the trend during the internet bubble. However, this did not lead to profitability until much later.\n",
      "\n",
      " In 1998, Yahoo bought Viaweb, which was a relief since the company had been at the mercy of investors who didn't have experience in startups, resulting in a mess. The stock of Viaweb was valuable since it was a profitable business.\"\n",
