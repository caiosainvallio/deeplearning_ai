In some cases, mainly in presidential systems, there is only one leader being both head of state and head of government. In other cases, mainly in semi-presidential and parliamentary systems, the head of state and the head of government are different people. In semi-presidential and parliamentary systems, the head of government role (i.e. executive branch) is fulfilled by both the listed head of government and the head of state. In single-party systems, ruling party's leader (i.e. General Secretary) is usually the de facto top leader of the state, though sometimes this leader also holds the presidency or premiership.\n",

      "Summary: This is a list of current state leaders ordered by their continuous tenure in a position of national leadership. For countries in which the head of state and head of government are separate, both offices are listed. For leaders who held the same office prior to their state's independence, the start of their tenure is used, not independence. For a list of heads of state taking dates of independence into account, see List of heads of state by diplomatic precedence.\n",
      "Acting presidents are included in this list, but if a leader has non-consecutive terms, only the current period of service is listed.\n",
      "States where head of state differs from head of government are mainly parliamentary systems. Often a leader holds both positions in presidential systems or dictatorships. Some states have semi-presidential systems where the head of government role is fulfilled by both the listed head of government and the head of state.\n",

      "Summary: Japan (Japanese: 日本, [ɲihoɴ] , Nippon or Nihon, and formally 日本国, Nippon-koku or Nihon-koku) is an island country in East Asia. It is in the northwest Pacific Ocean and is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan, extending from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north toward the East China Sea, Philippine Sea, and Taiwan in the south. Japan is a part of the Ring of Fire, and spans an archipelago of 14,125 islands, with the five main islands being Hokkaido, Honshu (the \"mainland\"), Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa. Tokyo is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Fukuoka, Kobe, and Kyoto.\n",
      "Japan has over 125 million inhabitants and is the 11th most populous country in the world, as well as one of the most densely populated. About three-fourths of the country's terrain is mountainous, concentrating its highly urbanized population on narrow coastal plains. Japan is divided into 47 administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world. Japan has the world's highest life expectancy, although it is experiencing a population decline due to its very low birth rate.\n",
      "Japan has been inhabited since the Upper Paleolithic period (30,000 BC). Between the fourth and ninth centuries, the kingdoms of Japan became unified under an emperor and the imperial court based in Heian-kyō. Beginning in the 12th century, political power was held by a series of military dictators (shōgun) and feudal lords (daimyō), and enforced by a class of warrior nobility (samurai). After a century-long period of civil war, the country was reunified in 1603 under the Tokugawa shogunate, which enacted an isolationist foreign policy. In 1854, a United States fleet forced Japan to open trade to the West, which led to the end of the shogunate and the restoration of imperial power in 1868. In the Meiji period, the Empire of Japan adopted a Western-modeled constitution, and\u001b[0m\n",

      " The speaker recounts their experience with computers before the era of microcomputers, when they did not have access to data storage and thus could not program anything interesting.

Withmicrocomputers, the speaker implies, possibilities increased for the speaker.\n",

      " A high school student learned simple programming and used it to program a model rocket predictor and a word processor for their father to write a book. Despite their programming experience, they planned to study philosophy in college instead of computers, perceiving it to be more powerful and to deal with ultimate truths. Upon arriving in college, the student found that many other fields took up much of the time and energy.\n",

      "In the 1970s, an AI program named SHRDLU generated excitement for the idea of teaching machines to be intelligent. As a response to this, the narrator begins teaching himself Lisp, the language then regarded as the language of AI. This was due to the fact that programming languages of the era were primitive and lacked the capabilities of AI. The narrator then went to Cornell where the default language was PL/I, a Pascal-like language.\n",

The low-level processes allow us to quickly recognize and identify objects, but they don't provide the intricate details necessary for something like painting a still life. Painting a still life requires a closer look at the details, which helps to re-enforce the importance of the low-level processes.\n",

      "\" Robert recommended Trevor Blackwell, a person known for his thoughts to reduce things to a stack of notecards, to assist him in his programming project that he had been working on for 3 years. Robert and Trevor were both independent minded and worked together well, having a lot of fun throughout the project.\n",
      "\n",
      " This narrates a story of the founding of a company that opened six stores. The program they created from software was split into three parts- an editor, a shopping cart, and a server. Inside the brain of the two founders, RTM and Trevor, the ideas were drastically different, resembling colonial New England in one and Austrian Rococo in the other. Despite the anticipation of the concept, people did not readily begin utilizing the ecommerce store idea.\n",
      "\n",
      " In the second half of the 90s, amid a lot of startups making ecommerce software, the editor was one of the best general-purpose site builders created by Robert and Trevor. The code was kept tight and did not require integration with other software which made it enjoyable for the programmer. Had the programmer only been required to work on editor software, the next 3 years would have been easy. However, the programmer had to do a lot of other stuff they were not as skilled at, therefore making the next 3 years stressful. Their goal was to be the Microsoft Word of the software industry.\n",
      "\n",
      " Viaweb created the Interleaf, a user-friendly and cost-effective online store platform that charged a monthly fee of $100 (small store) or $300 (big store). Surprisingly, this low price was not the result of an insightful decision, but simply due to their lack of knowledge about business expenses. As such, their success was partly due to their \"accidental\" use of what is now known as \"doing things that don't scale.\"\n",
      "\n",
      " In the early days of software, the lack of users drove desperate strategies such as building stores. This contradicted the point of the software as people would usually make their own stores. Through this experience, the team learned a lot about retail such as the importance of a closeup of the shirt's collar over a picture of the whole shirt.\n",
      "\n",
      " The speaker had to rescan 30 images of men's shirts. Through the process of building the store for users, the speaker began to understand the value of retail and became more familiar with the idea of \"business\". The speaker grew to be open to \"business\" and users in the same way they grew to be a father. As users requested things, they embraced their needs and hoped to have so many users one day that they wouldn't be able to provide everything they requested.\n",
      "\n",
      " In the end, the growth rate is the ultimate measure of success for a startup, rather than the absolute number of users. However, this was not realized until later. If this situation had occurred with a company that was advised at Y Combinator, the advice would be to stop being concerned and focus on the growth rate instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker initially gave advice to the listener to not hire too many people in order to become profitable and control their destiny. However, they succumbed to the pressure of investors as well as the allure of the 'Internet Bubble' of the time to hire more people than recommended, delaying their pursuit of profitability and placing them at the mercy of their investors for the life of their company.\n",
      "\n",
      " In principle, the Viaweb stock acquired during their startup was valuable as the business was profitable and growing, but the founders had yet to significantly change their lifestyle as a result. When Yahoo bought them, it felt like going from rags to riches, and the founder purchased a yellow 1998 VW GTI to mark the occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      " The speaker spent an unproductive year after the sale of Viaweb to Yahoo. Feeling drained and conforming to Yahoo's company culture, he failed to continue his previous working mode of programming until the morning. He found himself working in a similar way as before at Interleaf, and did not think that the stocks of Yahoo would be worth his options.\n",

      "A young man left his job at Yahoo after his stock options increased fivefold in the following year. He had been so consumed by software and menswear that he forgot his dream to paint.

      "\n",
      " After selling his company, the author's advice to other founders was to take a vacation. After attempting to paint in California but failing due to a lack of community and energy, he returned to New York where the rental market allowed him to better acclimatize.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After returning to New York to resume his old life, the individual finds he is now more financially secure and is able to do things he did not do before, such as take taxis and eat in restaurants. Painting also starts going better as he experiments more.\n",
      "\n",
      " In the Spring of 2000, the author decided to combine two ideas: creating a new kind of still life painting from the same objects, and creating a web application - the becoming of Viaweb.

      " The narrator was attempting to get Robert to work on their new project, but Robert declined due to the time investment required. The narrator then went on to recruit Dan Giffin, two undergraduate students, and got to work building the software with a dialect of their chosen language.\n",
      "\n",
      " In order to create a software as a service company, the narrator, along with their team, proposed the name \"Aspra\" and began developing the application builder, network infrastructure, and two services (images and phone calls). However, halfway through the summer, the narrator decided that they did not want to lead the business.\n",
      "\n",
      " After realizing he no longer needed money, the author began to ponder why he was continuing the project. He decided to build a subset of the project as an open source project and was surprised to find his efforts were not wasted after all. After starting Y Combinator, he encountered startups working on the same new architecture and found his past experiences were invaluable. The subset of the project would be created using Lisp.\n",
      "\n",
      " Dan and the author switched to creating a new dialect of Lisp, which the author dubbed Arc. At a Lisp conference, the author gave a talk about their experience using Lisp at Viaweb, and a postscript file of the talk was put online.\n",

      " By publishing on paulgraham.com, using Viaweb which he had created years before and never used for anything, Paul Graham quickly gained an audience with 30,000 page views when someone posted it to Slashdot.

      "\n",
      "In 1993, the web made it possible for almost anyone to publish an essay, although not many people were aware of this. It took a web builder and writer 8 years to understand the implications, which meant that a wide range of people could now publish essays if they had access to the web. Before this, the channel for publishing essays was limited to certain circles and only experts in their fields could write on their topics.\n",
      "\n",
      " When the option of publishing essays online became available, the writer decided to make it a point to always write essays, even though they may not be taken seriously and seen as just rants by nutjobs. They knew they had to continue to write online essays to get them taken seriously.\n",

      " A person's ambition can lead them astray if their motives are impure. This is avoided by focusing on work that is not necessarily prestigious, as it can still lead to meaningful discoveries and shows that your motives are pure.

      " In this essay, the author suggests that venture capitalists should invest in smaller amounts with more technical and youthful founders, allowing them to remain in control of their business and avoid making mistakes. Additionally, he suggests that a good way to write an essay is to give a talk, as this can be a great way to spur the imagination. Finally, he gave a talk about how to start a startup to the Harvard Computer Society.\n",
      "\n",
      " In giving a talk to new startup founders, the speaker mentioned the best sources of seed funding were successful startup founders. Afterwards, the speaker realized they should have taken their own advice and finally invest in an angel investment, as they had been meaning to do since Yahoo bought them 7 years ago. They had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects in that time.\n",
      "\n",
      " On March 11, Jessica and the narrator had an idea: to start their own investment firm and fund it themselves, involving Robert and Trevor as partners. They had no idea how to go about it but decided to go ahead regardless. They were unaware of the VCs in Boston at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      " Y Combinator created a novel concept that combined the roles of a venture capital firm and an individual angel investor. VC firms would make larger investments, while angel investors focused on smaller investments as a side job, but neither of these services provided the help founders needed.\n",
      "\n",
      " The founders of Y Combinator remember how helpless they once were when starting out, and their goal is to help other founders in a similar manner through setting up a company, providing seed investments, and offering general advice and resources. Y Combinator is not organized as a formal fund and is run by the founders' own money.\n",
      "\n",
      " YC is an investment group that funds batches of startups twice a year and offers intensive support over the three months following.

      "\n",
      "This idea involves a summer program for undergrads to start their own startups instead of settling for temporary jobs at tech companies. The idea is to use a building owned in Cambridge as the headquarters, and to have dinner there once a week for everyone involved. This would be a great opportunity for the undergrads to have an interesting summer, and also for the organizers to practice being investors.\n",
      "\n",
      " In a matter of days, the author organized an event called the Summer Founders Program to invite undergraduates to apply. Surprisingly, they also received 225 applications from people who had already graduated or were about to, showing that the event had become increasingly popular.\n",
      "\n",
      " The first batch of participants in Y Combinator's Summer Founders Program were successful entrepreneurs, including Reddit, Twitch, and Sam Altman, suggesting that their selection wasn't entirely luck. The 8 participants were chosen from the 20 of the initial 225 groups that were interviewed in person.\n",
      "\n",
      " The deal for startups was based on a combination of a prior deal that offered $10k for 10% equity and an MIT offer of $6k for 6% equity. This became a standard solution of $6k for 6% equity for two founders and in the first summer of the deal, the founders were also offered free air conditioners. The deal was convenient for the startup funders as it allowed them to do things for many startups.\n",
      "\n",
      " Being part of a batch was beneficial to start-ups because it solved isolation issues, created a tight alumni community, and resulted in startups becoming one another’s customers. The alumni help the current batches and YC GDP grows, resulting in more success.\n",
      "\n",
      " In 2006, Robert and Paul Graham started to work on Y Combinator to initially get customers from their batchmates. Graham still split his attention between YC, coding, and writing essays. They worked on a new version of Arc and Graham wrote Hacker News for it, which served as a news aggregator for startup founders.\n",
      "\n",
      " The author created the platform 'Startup News', but soon realized they wanted to reach people not yet in the startup world, so changed it to be called 'Hacker News.' Though the platform was good for YC (their company) it came at great stress to the author, feeling as though it was not central to their work.\n",
      "\n",
      " This essay focuses on the author's experiences at Y Combinator and his experience with programming language Arc. He wrote YC's internal software in Arc and dealt with HN issues 60% of the time. He stopped working on Arc partly because he didn't have time and partly because it became a lot less attractive to work on the language with their infrastructure depending on it, leaving him with two projects: writing essays and working on HN.\"\n",

      "In 2012, the author's mother had a stroke due to colon cancer. The author and their sister worked to help their mother get out of the nursing home, which gave the author a lot of time to think while flying up to Oregon. On one of these flights, the author realized it was time to hand over the reigns of YC, an organization the author had been leading. When the author asked their sister if she wanted to be president, she did not.\n",
      "\n",
      " Four founders of Y Combinator wanted YC to last for a long time, and to do so it needed to be restructured. This led them to recruit Sam Altman as president, causing them to retire and Jessica and Trevor to become ordinary partners. Initially, Sam refused, but eventually conceded after continued persuasion. This ultimately resulted in a complete changing of the guard for Y Combinator.\n",
      "\n",
      " In 2013, the author began preparing to transition to Sam running YC more, partially due to being focused on a mother with cancer. After the mother passed away, the author finished up the winter 2014 batch before taking some time away from work. They looked for new and different opportunities to occupy their time, ultimately deciding what to do next.\n",
      "\n",
      " After leaving YC, the author began painting in 2014 with the aim of improving. They worked on paintings continuously throughout the year and gradually improved but in November they suddenly lost interest in finishing the painting they were working on and felt overwhelmed.\n",
      "\n",
      " After a period of painting, the author decided to refocus his attention and wrote essays about startups as well as other topics. In March 2015, he returned to Lisp, a programming language that has a unique core language.\n",
      "\n",
      " John McCarthy discovered Lisp as an answer to the minimum set of predefined operators needed to write an interpreter for a language in itself. His student Steve Russell then suggested it could be used to program computers, which he translated into IBM 704 machine language and facilitated its use as a programming language.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "John McCarthy created Lisp in 1960 as a model of computation that had a power and elegance unmatched by other languages. Though it was missing key elements of a programming language, they were added without using McCarthy's original approach due to feasibility. McCarthy manually tested his interpreter and was getting close to the limit of interpreters that could be tested this way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2015, John McCarthy developed the Lisp programming language, but there was a bug in it. Due to computer power not being sufficient to test it, it remained unresolved until 2019 when the author, determined to find a complete programming language with discoveredness-preserving qualities, took 4 years to create one.\n",
      "\n",
      "  This person devoted their time to writing a Lisp, called Bel, in Arc. Through a combination of hacks, they were able to make it run, albeit at a slower speed. They had to ban themselves from writing essays while they were working on it, otherwise they'd never have finished. They found that after a 3 month hiatus from the project and having spent time writing essays, they had difficulty understanding their own code.\n",
      "\n",
      " Paul Graham faced difficulties and skepticism while writing an interpreter written in itself. Despite this, he worked harder than ever to get Bel done and enjoyed doing so. While working on Bel, he received comments asking if he still coded. This experience was both challenging and rewarding.\n",
      "\n",
      " In 2015, while taking his children to the coast, the author figured out how to solve a coding problem while watching them play. He felt satisfied by this experience, and had more similar experiences in the following years. In 2016, the family moved to England so the children could experience living in another country, as the author was a citizen by birth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bel was written in England by someone who had originally intended to stay for one year, but ended up living there longer. In 2019 the project was completed as a spec expressed as code. In 2020, after writing more essays, the individual thought about their past work choices and wrote a long, messy essay to answer that question.\n",
      "\n",
      " The author recounts their journey of going from batch processing to microcomputers, bypassing the step of time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. They indicate that, when it comes to learning the language, understanding abstract concepts from English words is easier than everyday words, except for the occasional trap.\n",
      "\n",
      " The author reflects on the experience of living in Florence and his daily walks along the spine of old Florence, noting the variety of conditions encountered there - from empty dark winter evenings to packed summer days. He also reflects on the possibility of painting people like still lives.\n",
      "\n",
      " Of still life painting can produce pained expressions for sitters, while in the 1990s Intel's processing power caused many special-purpose companies to become obsolete. In the art world, expensive things generally equal coolness, while technically an apartment may not be rent-controlled but may still come to acquire a rent-controlled status.\n",
      "\n",
      " The speaker had to launch an online store builder privately, to recruit an initial set of users, and make sure their stores looked good. The speaker was also using a code editor, unbeknownst to the users, to define their own page styles. The speaker was able to do this at an incredibly cheap price due to rent-stabilization, which only locals would know or care about.\n",
      "\n",
      " This was the first instance of a familiar experience when an editor was made for an app, however people reacted angrily to finding out that Lisp was better than other languages. People often feel sorry for the author, however the author replies that this has always been like this since the beginning as it comes with the territory.\n",
      "\n",
      " The internet in the 1990s allowed information to be put online, however publishing online meant treating it as the primary version. Y Combinator's experience shows that customs and restrictions still continue to constrain even when the reasons for them have gone, as starting a business used to be much more expensive and rare.\n",
      "\n",
      " In the print era, customs around essay writing were reflective of the constraints of the time. This implies that those who are less influenced by convention and more independent-minded may be more successful in fields with rapid change. However, it can be difficult to predict what fields are affected by rapid change- software, venture capital, and essay writing were all unexpected. Originally, Y Combinator was called Cambridge Seed; however, the name was changed to be more regionally inclusive in case of expansion.\n",
      "\n",
      " In Silicon Valley after being copied, the founders renamed their company the Y Combinator which is inspired by the lambda calculus. They chose orange as their color to differentiate themselves and stand out from other venture capitalists. The YC logo was an inside joke referencing their previous logo; an orange square with a white Y. From 2009-2011 YC also became a fund to keep up with the growth.\n",
      "\n",
      " YCombinator challenges the notion that the number of startups is fixed, and their aim is to create those that otherwise would not exist. Furthermore, this article highlights a problem with running a forum and writing essays at the same time, as well as an example of how being bought by Heroku allowed YCombinator to become self-funded once again.\n",
      "\n",
      " Leaving Y Combinator was not the worst part of the experience for the author; it was having to deal with the fact that people post highly imaginative misinterpretations of their personal conversations and essays, and that responding to the misinterpretations is assumed to be an admission of their correctness, thereby encouraging more people to start fights with the author.\n",
      "\n",
      " Two friends had been working together on a project for a long time, and the idea of leaving it was like removing a deeply rooted tree. The concept of discovered and invented is discussed in terms of space aliens, as a sufficiently advanced civilization will likely know about the Pythagorean theorem, and McCarthy's 1960 paper on Lisp, but there might be a language that is even further advanced that could be known to them as well.\n",
      "\n",
      " This piece provides evidence that there is an existing path of 'discoveredness' that derives from McCarthy's Lisp. Its conclusion is supported by the contributions of the aforementioned eight people, who read through the drafts of the article.\"\n",

      "Summary: Pegasus is a spyware developed by the Israeli cyber-arms company NSO Group that is designed to be covertly and remotely installed on mobile phones running iOS and Android. While NSO Group markets Pegasus as a product for fighting crime and terrorism, governments around the world have routinely used the spyware to surveil journalists, lawyers, political dissidents, and human rights activists.As of March 2023, Pegasus operators were able to remotely install the spyware on iOS versions through 16.0.3 using a zero-click exploit. While the capabilities of Pegasus may vary over time due to software updates, Pegasus is generally capable of reading text messages, call snooping, collecting passwords, location tracking, accessing the target device's microphone and camera, and harvesting information from apps. The spyware is named after Pegasus, the winged horse of Greek mythology.Cyber watchdog Citizen Lab and Lookout Security published the first public technical analyses of Pegasus in August 2016 after they captured the spyware in a failed attempt to spy on the iPhone of a human rights activist. Subsequent investigations into Pegasus by Amnesty International, Citizen Lab, and others have garnered significant media attention, most prominently in July 2021 with the release of the Pegasus Project investigation, which centered on a leaked list of 50,000 phone numbers reportedly selected for targeting by Pegasus customers.\u001b[0m\n",
